# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on **breast cancer classification** using various **Machine Learning (ML) models** under facaulty **Alice Nithya**. The primary objective is to compare the performance of multiple algorithms to determine which one provides the **highest accuracy** in predicting whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.

Breast cancer detection plays a crucial role in early diagnosis, which can significantly improve treatment outcomes. By evaluating and comparing multiple ML models, this project aims to identify the most effective approach for accurate classification.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Analysis:** Explore and preprocess breast cancer datasets to ensure clean and usable data.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate multiple ML algorithms, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Gradient Boosting Models
- **Performance Metrics:** Compare models using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
- **Visualization:** Provide clear visualizations of the results for better interpretability.
