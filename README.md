Breast Cancer Classification
Overview
This project focuses on comparative analysis of different machine learning (ML) models for the classification of breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The aim is to evaluate, compare, and identify the algorithm that achieves the highest accuracy and reliability in predictions.

The dataset contains important medical diagnostic measurements, and the models are trained to learn patterns that differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. The results can be valuable for aiding early detection and supporting medical decision-making.

This is not just an academic exercise — early and accurate diagnosis can potentially save lives, and the project demonstrates how ML can play a crucial role in healthcare.

This project is under the guidance of Alice Nithya Ma’am and is part of an ongoing research project.

Objectives
Compare multiple machine learning algorithms for breast cancer classification.

Identify the most accurate and reliable model.

Provide detailed performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Study the trade-offs between different algorithms in terms of speed, interpretability, and robustness.

Dataset
We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset which contains:

Features: 30 numerical features describing tumor characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness).

Target Variable:

0 → Malignant

1 → Benign

Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

Each model was trained and evaluated to determine:

Accuracy
